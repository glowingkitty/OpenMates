## Project Overview

*   **Project Name:** OpenMates
*   **Description:** OpenMates provides digital team mates designed to help users with questions and fulfill everyday tasks using integrated apps. The primary goal is to assist a wide range of individuals with practical aspects of life, such as finding doctor appointments, improving health habits, advancing careers, building businesses, and learning new skills.

*   **Primary Audience:** A broad audience of everyday people seeking assistance with various life tasks and goals, including those with limited technical or AI experience.
*   **Secondary Audience:** Developers who can utilize the OpenMates API.

It should avoid corporate jargon and focus on empowering users easily, without requiring specialized knowledge like prompt engineering (except for developer documentation which can be more technical).
