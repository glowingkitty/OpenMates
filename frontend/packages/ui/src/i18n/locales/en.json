                "text": "Great question! OpenMates stands out in several key ways:\n\n## 🤝 Optimized Mates for Every Task\n\nInstead of one generic assistant, OpenMates automatically routes your request to specialized \"Mates\" optimized for different domains:\n\n- **Sophia** - Software development expert (coding, architecture, debugging)\n- **Burton** - Business development (strategy, market analysis, growth)\n- **Melvin** - Medical & health information (with proper disclaimers)\n- **Leon** - Legal topics (educational, not legal advice)\n- **Makani** - Maker & rapid prototyping (DIY, 3D printing, electronics)\n- **Mark** - Marketing & sales strategies\n- **Finn** - Finance & investment information\n- **Denise** - Design (UI/UX, graphic design, aesthetics)\n- **Plus more** - History, Science, Life Coaching, Cooking, and more!\n\nEach Mate has a specialized system prompt and expertise area, ensuring you get the most relevant and capable assistant for your specific task.\n\n## 📝 Multiple Drafts Support\n\nOpenMates supports **multiple conversation drafts** - allowing you to:\n- Explore different approaches to the same problem\n- Compare various solutions side-by-side\n- Keep alternative conversation paths without losing context\n- Work on multiple versions of creative content\n\nThis encourages experimentation and iterative thinking.\n\n## 🔒 Zero-Knowledge Encryption\n\nYour privacy is architecturally guaranteed:\n- **Zero-knowledge storage** - The server cannot decrypt your stored chats by itself\n- **Device-controlled processing** - Your device must decrypt and send chats to the server for AI processing\n- **Encrypted at rest** - Stored messages are encrypted and require your device's participation to decrypt\n- **Transparent security** - Open source code you can audit\n\n**Important to understand:** While your chats are encrypted when stored, they must be decrypted during AI processing. This means the server can read messages while processing them, but cannot access stored messages without your device's active participation.\n\nThis is more secure than services that can access all your data anytime, but less private than fully local AI processing.\n\n## ⚡ Performance-Optimized UX\n\nBuilt for real-world usability:\n- **Fast, responsive interface** - Optimized for performance at every level\n- **Intuitive design** - Clean, simple UI that gets out of your way\n- **Accessible by default** - Screen reader support, keyboard navigation\n- **Progressive enhancement** - Works on all devices and connection speeds\n\nThe design philosophy: Make AI assistance feel natural and effortless.\n\n## 🌱 Coming Soon: Apps & Skills\n\nWe're actively developing:\n- **Web Search** - Real-time information from the internet\n- **Code Execution** - Run and test code safely\n- **File Analysis** - Work with documents and data\n- **And more tools** to make your AI teammate even more capable!\n\n---\n\n**In short:** OpenMates gives you specialized expertise, true privacy, flexible thinking, and a UX designed for humans - not just impressive demos.\n\nWant to dive deeper into any of these features?",
