# backend/core/directus/schemas/embeds.yml
# Defines the schema for the 'embeds' collection in Directus.
# Embeds are separate entities from messages, stored independently and referenced in messages via lightweight JSON blocks.
# All sensitive fields (type, chat_id, message_id, task_id) are protected client-side before storage to maintain zero-knowledge architecture.
embeds:
  type: collection
  fields:
    id:
      type: uuid
      note: "Primary Key - Unique identifier for the embed, auto-generated by Directus."

    embed_id:
      type: string
      note: "[Indexed] Unique identifier for the embed. Format: UUID v4. Generated by the client or server."
      options:
        unique: true

    hashed_chat_id:
      type: string
      note: "[Indexed] SHA256 hash of chat_id (for linking without exposing actual chat_id, protects privacy). Client-side hashed before sending to server."

    hashed_message_id:
      type: string
      note: "[Indexed] SHA256 hash of message_id (for linking without exposing actual message_id, protects privacy). Client-side hashed before sending to server. Can be null if referenced by multiple messages."

    hashed_task_id:
      type: string
      note: "[Optional] SHA256 hash of task_id (for long-running tasks, protects privacy). Used to update embed when task completes. Client-side hashed before sending to server."

    encrypted_type:
      type: string
      note: "[Encrypted] Type of embed encrypted client-side (app_skill_use, website, place, event, code, file, sheet, document, etc.). Server cannot determine embed type without decryption key. Encrypted with same key as encrypted_content."

    status:
      type: string
      note: "Status of embed: 'processing' | 'finished' | 'error'"

    hashed_user_id:
      type: string
      note: "[Indexed] Hashed user ID of embed owner"

    # NOTE: encryption_key_embed moved to embed_keys collection
    # This allows multiple wrapped versions (master key + per-chat keys) for offline sharing
    # See embed_keys.yml for the new schema

    is_private:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      note: "Whether this embed is private (not shared). If true, the embed is not accessible via share links. Defaults to false (shareable) to enable offline sharing. When a user unshares an embed, this is set to true. The security model relies on: (1) Embed IDs are not easily guessable, (2) Encryption key in URL fragment is required to decrypt, (3) Server returns dummy data for non-existent embeds to prevent enumeration, (4) Rate limiting on share endpoints."

    is_shared:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      note: "Whether this embed has been shared (share link generated). Set to true on client when share link is created, then synced to server. Used to track which embeds appear in the 'Shared' menu. When unsharing, both is_private and is_shared are updated."

    shared_with_users:
      type: json
      note: "[Optional] Array of hashed_user_ids who have access (for user-specific sharing)"

    embed_ids:
      type: json
      note: "[Optional] Array of embed IDs for composite app_skill_use embeds (e.g., web search contains embed_ids pointing to website embeds). Null for single embeds or non-app_skill_use embeds."

    encrypted_content:
      type: textfield
      note: "[Encrypted] Full embed content (TOON format string). For app_skill_use embeds with composite results, contains query, provider, skill name, and metadata. For single embeds (code, file, sheet, document, website, place, event), contains the actual content. Encrypted with encryption_key_embed (private) or shared_encryption_key (shared). Content is stored as TOON string for space efficiency (30-60% savings vs JSON)."

    encrypted_text_preview:
      type: textfield
      note: "[Encrypted] Lightweight text preview for text-based embeds (code, documents). Always synced to client for fast rendering. Encrypted with same key as encrypted_content."

    parent_embed_id:
      type: string
      note: "[Optional] For versioned embeds: references the parent embed_id this version is based on"

    version_number:
      type: integer
      note: "[Optional] Version number for this embed (starts at 1, increments on updates)"

    encrypted_diff:
      type: textfield
      note: "[Encrypted] For file updates: stores diff/patch between versions (unified diff format). Encrypted with same key as encrypted_content."

    file_path:
      type: string
      note: "[Optional] For code/file embeds: relative file path for detecting updates to same file"

    content_hash:
      type: string
      note: "[Indexed] SHA256 hash of embed content. Used for duplicate detection (file, code, sheet, document) and change detection (versioning). Not used for website, place, event, or app_skill_use embeds."

    created_at:
      type: integer
      note: "Unix timestamp (seconds) when the embed was created. Provided by the application."

    updated_at:
      type: integer
      note: "Unix timestamp (seconds) when the embed was last updated. Used for task completion updates and versioning."

    encryption_mode:
      type: string
      default: "client"
      note: "Encryption strategy: 'client' (zero-knowledge, default) or 'vault' (server-managed, for server-generated files like images/PDFs)."

    vault_key_id:
      type: string
      note: "[Optional] For encryption_mode='vault': The user's Vault key ID used to encrypt the content. Allows server-side decryption for AI modification or download."

    s3_file_keys:
      type: json
      note: '[Optional] Server-accessible list of S3 file keys (paths) associated with this embed. Used for S3 cleanup when the embed or its parent chat is deleted. Only populated for embeds that store files in S3 (e.g., image generation). Format: [{"bucket": "chatfiles", "key": "user_id/timestamp_id_format.ext"}, ...]. Not privacy-sensitive since files are AES-256-GCM encrypted in S3.'
