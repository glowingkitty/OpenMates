# backend/core/directus/schemas/onboarding_usecases.yml
# Defines the schema for the 'onboarding_usecases' collection in Directus.
# This collection stores ANONYMOUS use-case summaries from the onboarding chat.
# IMPORTANT: This collection deliberately has NO user reference field.
# Data is fully anonymous — only summary text, language, and timestamp are stored.
# Used by the openmates app's share-usecase skill.
