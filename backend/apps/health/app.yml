skills:

  # NOTE: Tested getting appointments with Doctolib, but reverse engineering the API is not easy.
  # Website returns complex html document, no simple fetch requests.
  # Also tested using director.ai (and of course since Doctolib's UI is so terrible, the AI takes ages to figure our how to search and also then doesn't )
  # Idea: combine firecrawl, their API and director.ai / stagehand to get next available appointments and return those to user.

  # Jameda: also not perfect, but at least with workaround should be possible to combine firecrawl + their API endpoints for finding available appointments.
