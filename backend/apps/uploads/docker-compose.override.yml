# backend/apps/uploads/docker-compose.override.yml
#
# Development overrides for the uploads service.
# Applied automatically when running docker compose from the uploads directory on the dev server.
#
# KEY DIFFERENCES FROM PRODUCTION:
#   - app-uploads joins the 'openmates' Docker network (core stack) so that
#     CORE_API_URL=http://api:8000 resolves via Docker DNS.
#   - Port 8004 is exposed on localhost so Caddy can proxy /api/uploads/* to it.
#   - The local Vault also joins the 'openmates' network for easier debugging
#     (e.g. curl from other containers), though this is not required for operation.
#
# On the production uploads VM, NONE of these overrides are needed:
#   - Use CORE_API_URL=<private_IP_of_api_server> instead of Docker DNS.
#   - Do not expose port 8004; the uploads VM is accessed via upload.openmates.org (Caddy on that VM).
