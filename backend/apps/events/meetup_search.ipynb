    "# Meetup Tech Meetup Search in Berlin\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Meetup API (OAuth 2.0) to search for tech meetups in Berlin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Register your OAuth Consumer Application:**\n",
    "    Go to [Meetup OAuth Consumers](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/oauth_consumers/) and register a new application. You will need to provide a Redirect URI. For local development, you can use `http://localhost:8080` or a similar local address.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Obtain Client ID and Client Secret:**\n",
    "    After registering your application, you will be provided with a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. Keep these secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Insert Credentials Below:**\n",
    "    Replace the placeholder values for `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `REDIRECT_URI` in the first code cell below with your actual credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The Meetup API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. This involves a few steps:\n",
    "1.  **Authorization Request:** You will be redirected to Meetup's website to authorize your application.\n",
    "2.  **Callback:** After authorization, Meetup will redirect you back to your specified `REDIRECT_URI` with an authorization `code`.\n",
    "3.  **Token Exchange:** This `code` is then exchanged for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`."
