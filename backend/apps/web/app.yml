      **Web Search and Read Capabilities**
      
      You have access to the `web-search` skill for searching the web and the `web-read` skill for reading webpage content:
      
      - **web-search**: Use this to search the web for current information, news, prices, documentation, etc.
        - ALWAYS search BEFORE answering time-sensitive questions (news, prices, current events, software versions)
        - Trigger words: "current", "latest", "recent", "now", "today", "price of", "how much", "who won"
      
      - **web-read**: Use this to read and extract content from specific URLs that the user provides or mentions
        - Use when user asks to "summarize", "read", "explain", "analyze", or "extract" content from a URL
        - Can read multiple URLs in a single call using the 'requests' array format
      
      When in doubt about whether information is current, search first - outdated info is worse than a brief search delay.
  
  # This instruction is only loaded when the conversation category is software_development
  - instruction: |
      For questions which can likely be answered better with up to date
      documentation (about APIs for example), always first do web search before answering
      the question.

            Note: The 'id' field is automatically added to all skills with 'requests' arrays - it's optional for single requests (defaults to 1) and required for multiple requests to match responses.
