      "\n",
      "Example:\n",

      "port = 7777\n",
      "\n",

      "proxies = {\n",

      "r = requests.get(\"https://httpbin.org/ip\", proxies=proxies, timeout=30)\n",
      "print(r.text)\n",
      "\n",
      "Notes:\n",
      "- For country targeting or sticky sessions, Oxylabs lets you add options into the username (e.g., country or session). Use the exact pattern shown in your dashboard/docs for your product/zone.\n",
      "- You can also set environment variables so all HTTP clients pick them up:\n",
      "  - HTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@host:port\n",
      "  - HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@host:port\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Using Oxylabs with youtube-transcript-api\n",

      "Install:\n",

      "Usage:\n",

      "username = \"customer-<your_customer>-zone-<your_zone>\"\n",
      "password = \"<your_password>\"\n",

      "print(transcripts)\n",
      "print(errors)\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Optional: adding cookies/headers if needed\n",
      "Some videos require consent/age cookies or specific headers. youtube-transcript-api lets you pass cookies and custom headers:\n",
      "\n",

      "    http_headers=headers,\n",
      "    languages=[\"en\"]\n",
      ")\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips\n",
      "- If you make many requests, consider sticky sessions (a session ID in the proxy username) to reduce blocks and keep the same egress IP for a while.\n",
      "- Residential proxies are typically more reliable for YouTube than datacenter IPs.\n",
      "- Proxies wonâ€™t create transcripts that donâ€™t exist or bypass video restrictions that require authentication; in those cases, cookies or being logged in may be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you share which Oxylabs product/zone youâ€™re using (residential rotating, static residential, or datacenter), I can tailor the exact username/endpoint format for you.\n"
