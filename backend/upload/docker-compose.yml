# backend/upload/docker-compose.yml
#
# Docker Compose for the OpenMates Upload Server (dedicated VM).
# Runs the upload microservice, ClamAV, and a local Vault.
#
# USAGE (on the upload VM):
#   cd ~/projects/OpenMates
#   docker compose -f backend/upload/docker-compose.yml up -d
#
# SECURITY ARCHITECTURE:
#   The uploads service runs on a SEPARATE VM with zero access to the main
#   Vault, Directus, or any user data. A local Vault (dev mode, in-memory)
#   stores ONLY S3 and SightEngine credentials. All Directus queries and
#   Vault Transit key wrapping are proxied through the core API's internal
#   endpoints (/internal/uploads/*), secured by INTERNAL_API_SHARED_TOKEN.
#
#   If this VM is compromised, the attacker gets:
#     - S3 write credentials (can upload junk, cannot read existing files)
#     - SightEngine API keys (benign — image classification only)
#   They CANNOT:
#     - Decrypt any existing files (no Transit decrypt access)
#     - Access user data (no Directus access)
#     - Reach the main Vault
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (define in backend/upload/.env):
#   PROD_CORE_API_URL                  — Private IP URL of the prod core API
#   PROD_INTERNAL_API_SHARED_TOKEN     — Shared secret matching the prod API server
#   DEV_CORE_API_URL                   — Private IP URL of the dev core API
#   DEV_INTERNAL_API_SHARED_TOKEN      — Shared secret matching the dev API server
#   UPLOADS_VAULT_ROOT_TOKEN           — Root token for the local Vault (random UUID)
#   SECRET__HETZNER__S3_ACCESS_KEY     — S3 access key (migrated into local Vault)
#   SECRET__HETZNER__S3_SECRET_KEY     — S3 secret key
#   SECRET__HETZNER__S3_REGION_NAME    — S3 region (e.g. nbg1)
#   SECRET__SIGHTENGINE__API_USER      — SightEngine API user (optional)
#   SECRET__SIGHTENGINE__API_SECRET    — SightEngine API secret
#   SERVER_ENVIRONMENT                 — "production"
#   LOG_LEVEL                          — "info" | "debug" | "warning"
