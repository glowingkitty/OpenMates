# backend/config/backend_config.yml
# Main configuration for the OpenMates backend API.

# List of enabled application IDs (service names) that the main API should discover and integrate with.
# Each app runs as a separate service (typically a Docker container) and exposes an internal API.
# It's assumed that each enabled app runs its internal FastAPI server on a default port (e.g., 8000),
# reachable via its service name (e.g., http://ai:8000).
enabled_apps:
  - "ai"
  # - "health"
  # - "travel"
  # - "another_app"

# Other backend-wide configurations can be added below.
# For example:
# global_settings:
#   default_language: "en"
#   max_request_size: "10mb"

# Logging configuration (can be overridden by environment variables)
logging:
  level: "INFO" # Default logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  format: "json"  # Logging format (e.g., "json", "text") - handled by setup_logging.py
