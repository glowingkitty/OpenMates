# backend/config/backend_config.yml
# Main configuration for the OpenMates backend API.

# Apps are automatically discovered by scanning the backend/apps directory.
# No manual configuration needed - new apps are available by default with server updates.
# 
# Apps are filtered by component stages based on SERVER_ENVIRONMENT:
# - Development server: Apps with 'development' or 'production' stage components are included
# - Production server: Apps with 'production' stage components only are included
# - Apps with no valid components are treated as 'planning' and excluded

# Optional: Explicitly disable apps (opt-out list)
# Only use this if you need to temporarily disable a problematic app.
# disabled_apps:
#   - "problematic_app"

# Other backend-wide configurations can be added below.
# For example:
# global_settings:
#   default_language: "en"
#   max_request_size: "10mb"

# Logging configuration (can be overridden by environment variables)
logging:
  level: "INFO" # Default logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  format: "json"  # Logging format (e.g., "json", "text") - handled by setup_logging.py
