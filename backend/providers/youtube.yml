    requests_per_second: 50 # Reasonable default for Residential Proxies (no hard limit, but good practice)

# Pricing information
# Cost per request in credits (user-facing pricing)
#
# Revenue Share Model (see docs/architecture/revenue_share_model.md):
# - User pays: 20 credits per transcript request
# - Creator (video owner) gets: 9 credits (claimable by channel owner)
# - YouTube gets: 1 credit (claimable by YouTube to cover their server costs)
# - OpenMates gets: 10 credits (covers operational costs, not tracked as creator income)
#
# This split:
# 1. Provides compensation to video creators (€0.009 per transcript)
# 2. Reserves credits for YouTube that they can claim to cover their server costs
# 3. Covers OpenMates operational costs
# 4. Keeps pricing competitive and fair for users (€0.02 per transcript)
#
# Users are always charged 20 credits per transcript request
# If a user makes 5 parallel transcript requests, they are charged 100 credits total (5 * 20)
pricing:
  per_request_credits: 20 # Always 20 credits per transcript request for users (9 to creator, 1 to YouTube, 10 to OpenMates)
