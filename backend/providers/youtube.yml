logo_svg: "logos/youtube.svg" # Path for UI, relative to a common logos directory

# API endpoint configuration
# Note: YouTube transcript extraction uses a proxy service
# The actual API endpoint is handled by the backend service

# Rate limiting configuration
# Based on Oxylabs Residential Proxies (used for YouTube transcript extraction)
# 
# Oxylabs Residential Proxies:
# - No specific rate limits on request submissions
# - Usage is governed by data allowance (GB per month)
# - Unlimited concurrent sessions allowed
# - Plans range from Pay-as-you-go (50GB/month) to higher tiers with more data
#
# Since there are no hard rate limits on Residential Proxies, we set a reasonable
# default that allows for good throughput while being mindful of data usage
rate_limits:
  default:
    requests_per_second: 50  # Reasonable default for Residential Proxies (no hard limit, but good practice)
    requests_per_day: null  # No daily limit (governed by monthly data allowance)

# Pricing information
# Cost per request in credits (user-facing pricing)
# 
# Revenue Share Model (see docs/architecture/revenue_share_model.md):
# - User pays: 20 credits per transcript request
# - Creator (video owner) gets: 10 credits (50% of user payment)
# - OpenMates gets: 10 credits (covers proxy service costs + operations margin)
#
# This 50/50 split:
# 1. Provides meaningful compensation to video creators (€0.01 per transcript)
# 2. Covers our proxy service costs with sustainable margin
# 3. Aligns with revenue share model principles
# 4. Keeps pricing competitive and fair for users (€0.02 per transcript)
#
# Users are always charged 20 credits per transcript request
# If a user makes 5 parallel transcript requests, they are charged 100 credits total (5 * 20)
pricing:
  per_request_credits: 20  # Always 20 credits per transcript request for users (10 to creator, 10 to OpenMates)
