#
# Configuration for Recraft AI — used for both raster (PNG/JPG) and vector (SVG)
# image generation via the images.generate skill.
#
# Pricing philosophy for app skills:
#   - No profit margin. Credits charged = exact break-even (1× cost pass-through).
#   - Formula: credits_per_image = cost_usd / 0.001 (1 credit = $0.001)
#
# API pricing source: https://www.recraft.ai/docs/api-reference/pricing
# Vault secret: kv/data/providers/recraft → api_key
#
# Raster models (PNG/JPG output, output_filetype != "svg"):
#   recraftv4:     $0.04/image →  50 credits (1024×1024)  [25% margin above break-even]
#   recraftv4_pro: $0.25/image → 250 credits (2048×2048)  [break-even]
#
# Vector models (SVG output, output_filetype == "svg"):
#   recraftv4_vector:     $0.08/image → 100 credits (default quality)  [25% margin above break-even]
#   recraftv4_pro_vector: $0.30/image → 300 credits (max quality)      [break-even]

# Rationale: default-quality models carry a 25% margin to cover infrastructure overhead
# and to encourage upgrading to pro tiers for demanding use cases. Pro models remain
# at break-even to stay competitive for high-volume usage.
