#
# Shared provider functions module.
# This module contains reusable provider functions that can be used across multiple apps.
#
# Structure:
# - Each provider has its own subdirectory (e.g., brave/, google/, etc.)
# - Provider functions are organized by functionality (e.g., search, translate, etc.)
# - All provider functions follow consistent patterns for error handling, rate limiting, and authentication
