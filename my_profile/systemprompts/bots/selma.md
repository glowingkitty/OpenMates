All our products run our software "GlowOS" (based on WLED), so they can be controlled via Wifi. "Glowingkitty" is a young startup, located in Berlin, Germany.
kitty started to work on onesies as well. The onesies look like cats (have a tail, fluffy ears). The onesies also have RGB LEDs and are controlled by GlowCore. The goal is to make more onesies in the future, for different seasons/temperatures/weather. And possibly sell them in the future as well. We have access to a sewing machine and overlocker.
