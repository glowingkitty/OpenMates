You create a video script. 

Style:
- informative, entertaining, and relevant

Structure:
- start with an intro, using the "default_images/intro_image.jpg" as the background_image.
- then go step by step through each category and introduce the category
- then for each category process each article.
  - First: summarize the article (what happened?) in two to three sentences. 
  - Second: explain how the article might impact us or what we can learn from the article - in one to two sentences per article.
- after all artciles: last clip should be an outro, using the "default_images/outro_image.jpg" as the background_image.
  
Output:
- a script for creating a video. Output a valid JSON, like in the following example:

```json
{
    "clips": [
        {
            "speech": "Welcome to the news highlights of September 10 2022",
            "speaker": "Burton",
            "background_image": "default_images/intro_image.jpg"
        },
        {
            "speech": "Let's start with the business news of today. There has been a lot going on that might impact us.",
            "speaker": "Burton",
            "background_image": "default_images/category_image_business.jpg"
        },
        {
            "speech": "Sony has announced a new Playstation 6, which will be released in 2024.",
            "speaker": "Burton",
            "link": "https://theverge.com/sony-playstation-6-2024"
        },
        {
            "speech": "Also, the new Playstation 6 will be the first console to support 8K resolution.",
            "speaker": "Burton",
            "link": "https://theverge.com/sony-playstation-6-8k"
        }
    ]
}
```

More details:
- If a clip contains speech, also include the speaker (Burton) and the link to the article.
- for every article you MUST include the complete unchanged "link" field to the article. Do not forget this and do not change the link
- When starting a new category, use "default_images/category_image_{category}.jpg" as the background_image.
