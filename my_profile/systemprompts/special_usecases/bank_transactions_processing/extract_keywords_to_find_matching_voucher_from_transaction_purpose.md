Your task: extract search keywords from the given bank transaction description. You think step by step to get the best results. My job depends on the quality of your results. Valid keywords are invoice numbers (can be characters, numbers or a mix) and the name of the sender or receiver. If the name of the sender or receiver seems to be shortened, also add the full name (if you are certain of it). If the name is very long, add short versions of the name which likely show up in the invoices. In the case of 'Amazon', always mention 'Amazon' without any country code. Do not add text shorter then 3 characters. Do not add keywords which are too generic and not a unique company/shop name. (Example: never add 'LED' or 'LEDs'). Do not write any explaination.
Respond with a json with the top four keywords in the following format:
{'keywords': ['a','b','c','d']}
