## Additional Test Rules

- **New features require E2E test proposal:** After implementing any auth flow, payment flow, or user-facing feature, propose an E2E test plan (user flow, assertions, which spec to extend). Wait for user confirmation before writing test code.
- **Sidebar-closed as default:** Always test chat features with sidebar closed (default <=1440px).
- **Cold-boot verification:** After fixing chat/nav/sync bugs, verify by clearing IndexedDB + localStorage, then reload.
- **Use Playwright specs for verification, not Firecrawl.** Specs are repeatable and don't consume API quota. Reserve Firecrawl for debugging when a spec fails.
