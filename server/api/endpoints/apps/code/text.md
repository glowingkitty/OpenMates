Implementing Celery with Dragonfly in Your FastAPI Application
Here’s how you can set up Celery with Dragonfly for your FastAPI application:

1. Setting Up the Environment
First, install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi uvicorn celery redis
Ensure that Dragonfly is running as your Redis-compatible in-memory store.

2. Celery Configuration
Create a celery.py file to configure Celery:

python
Copy code
from celery import Celery

# Configure Celery to use Dragonfly as the broker and backend
celery_app = Celery(
    "tasks",
    broker="redis://localhost:6379/0",  # Replace with your Dragonfly instance
    backend="redis://localhost:6379/0",  # Replace with your Dragonfly instance
)

celery_app.conf.update(
    task_serializer='json',
    accept_content=['json'],  
    result_serializer='json',
    timezone='UTC',
    enable_utc=True,
)
3. Defining Celery Tasks
In the same or a separate file, define the Celery tasks:

python
Copy code
from celery import shared_task
from time import sleep

@shared_task
def ask_llm(query: str) -> str:
    # Simulate a long-running LLM query
    sleep(10)  # Simulates delay for the LLM processing
    return f"Processed result for query: {query}"

@shared_task
def summarize_video(video_url: str) -> str:
    # Simulate a long-running video summarization task
    sleep(15)  # Simulates delay for video processing
    return f"Summary for video: {video_url}"
4. Integrating Celery with FastAPI
Now, integrate these tasks with your FastAPI application:

python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
from celery.result import AsyncResult
from .celery import celery_app
from .tasks import ask_llm, summarize_video

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/skills/ai/ask")
async def ask_ai(query: str):
    task = ask_llm.apply_async(args=[query])
    return {"task_id": task.id}

@app.post("/skills/video/summarize")
async def summarize(video_url: str):
    task = summarize_video.apply_async(args=[video_url])
    return {"task_id": task.id}

@app.get("/tasks/{task_id}")
async def get_task_result(task_id: str):
    task_result = AsyncResult(task_id, app=celery_app)
    if task_result.state == 'PENDING':
        return {"status": "Pending"}
    elif task_result.state == 'FAILURE':
        return {"status": "Failed", "error": str(task_result.result)}
    elif task_result.state == 'SUCCESS':
        return {"status": "Completed", "result": task_result.result}
    else:
        return {"status": task_result.state}
5. Running the Services
Run your FastAPI application:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
And start the Celery worker:

bash
Copy code
celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
Webhooks vs. WebSockets
Webhooks and WebSockets are both ways to receive notifications or updates, but they serve different purposes:

Webhooks:

Use Case: They are HTTP callbacks triggered by an event in your system. Typically used to notify external systems about an event (e.g., task completion).
One-Way Communication: The server sends a POST request to a predefined URL when an event occurs. It's one-time communication.
Example: Notify a third-party service when a task is completed.
WebSockets:

Use Case: WebSockets are persistent connections that allow real-time, two-way communication between the client and server.
Continuous Communication: Useful for real-time updates, such as status changes or live data feeds.
Example: Continuously updating the client about the progress of a long-running task.
Code Examples
Webhook Implementation
Add a webhook to notify a user when the task is complete:

Modifying the Task to Send a Webhook
python
Copy code
import requests

@shared_task
def ask_llm(query: str, webhook_url: str = None) -> str:
    # Simulate LLM processing
    sleep(10)
    result = f"Processed result for query: {query}"
    
    if webhook_url:
        # Send a POST request to the webhook URL with the result
        requests.post(webhook_url, json={"status": "Completed", "result": result})
    
    return result
Endpoint to Trigger the Task with Webhook
python
Copy code
@app.post("/skills/ai/ask-with-webhook")
async def ask_ai_with_webhook(query: str, webhook_url: str):
    task = ask_llm.apply_async(args=[query, webhook_url])
    return {"task_id": task.id}
WebSocket Implementation
To notify clients via WebSocket:

Add WebSocket Route in FastAPI
python
Copy code
from fastapi import WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect

@app.websocket("/ws/{client_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, client_id: str):
    await websocket.accept()
    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            await websocket.send_text(f"Message received from {client_id}: {data}")
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        print(f"Client {client_id} disconnected")
Integrating Task Completion with WebSocket
You would need to integrate your task results with the WebSocket connection, which is more complex because you’d need a way to keep track of which client is connected and their task. This usually involves a more complex setup, possibly using a pub/sub mechanism like Redis.

Should You Use Both Webhooks and WebSockets?
Webhooks are generally more straightforward and are great for notifying third-party systems or even your own clients if they can handle HTTP requests when events occur.
WebSockets are excellent for real-time communication where the client needs to continuously receive updates without polling.
When to use both:

Webhooks for systems that need an asynchronous notification after task completion.
WebSockets for real-time updates, such as showing task progress in a web dashboard.
In your context:

Use Webhooks if you want to notify a client or another service after a task completes.
Use WebSockets if you want to provide a real-time task progress update to a client who has an open connection.
If your system has a mixture of clients needing real-time updates (e.g., a dashboard) and others needing just a final result, using both makes sense.
