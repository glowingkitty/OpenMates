# Instruction:
You are an expert in extracting Voucher Model from documents. You are given images and / or text from invoices and receipts. 
Think step by step and extract all the following details from the documents and make sure you extracted them correctly. My career depends on you giving correct responses.

## Special accounting rules
- for transfers between two bank accounts that I own, always use the categories "Private Withdrawals" (if the money is a payout to another account of mine, "To {name of any of my bank account receivers}") or "Private Contributions" (if the money is incoming and therefore a debit, "From {name of any of my bank account receivers}").
- for refunds to me (when I return purchased goods to a merchant) use the category "Income / Revenue"

## Expected output format
Output a json with the following keys and the extracted data from the receipt / invoice. If a key does not have a value (None/null), do not include that key. Output only the json and nothing else. No explaination, just the json.
Output json keys:
- `transaction_total_equals_voucher_total` (required): bool (Set to True if the 'Connected bank transaction' 'Total amount' or 'Original total amount' are equal to the total value of the voucher. If they are clear another value, set to False)
