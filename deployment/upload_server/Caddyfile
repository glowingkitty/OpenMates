# deployment/upload_server/Caddyfile
#
# Production Caddyfile template for the OpenMates Upload Server VM.
#
# DO NOT EDIT PLACEHOLDERS MANUALLY — use the render script instead:
#   python scripts/render-deploy-config.py deployment/upload_server/Caddyfile
#
# Or render and apply directly on the server:
#   python scripts/render-deploy-config.py deployment/upload_server/Caddyfile \
#     | sudo tee /etc/caddy/Caddyfile > /dev/null
#   sudo systemctl reload caddy
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   - Terminates TLS via Let's Encrypt for the upload domain
#   - Proxies /health and /v1/upload/* to the app-uploads container on localhost:8000
#   - Adds security headers (HSTS, nosniff, etc.)
#   - Aborts all requests to paths not explicitly allowed
#
# SECURITY:
#   - Only /health and /v1/upload/* are routed — everything else is aborted
#   - The upload container is only exposed on localhost (127.0.0.1:8000)
#   - CORS is handled by the upload service itself (FastAPI middleware)
