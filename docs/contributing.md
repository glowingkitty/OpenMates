## Test OpenMates

Start testing OpenMates either via the cloud web app or by running the self-hosted version of OpenMates on your local machine or server (see the README.md for details on both).


## Understand the context

Before contributing, please check the [architecture](./architecture.md) and [design guidelines](./designguidelines.md) overviews. They should give you a better understanding of how OpenMates works, the core ideas behind OpenMates and how it's different to other AI agents software.


## Issues

Issues regarding OpenMates should be first discussed on [the Discord group](https://discord.gg/bHtkxZB5cc) and then posted to the project [Github issue page](https://github.com/glowingkitty/OpenMates/issues). And let's try to keep the issues organized and clear of duplicates (first search for existing issues and ask in Discord if the issue is known, then create the issue).
