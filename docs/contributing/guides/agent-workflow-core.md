# Agent Workflow Core

OpenCode is the primary OpenMates coding runtime. Claude Code remains the
canonical authoring source for project skills, subagents, hooks, and shared
rules; Codex and OpenCode consume generated or bridged mirrors.

Keep default context concise. Lazy-load detailed rules, docs, and skills only
when the task touches that area: frontend, backend, testing, privacy, settings,
embeds, Apple, specs, deployment, or provider integrations.

Before editing, discover the relevant files, source patterns, docs, and tests.
Use the smallest correct change. Prefer deterministic audits or focused tests
when repeated mistakes, flaky behavior, safety risks, or workflow drift are
found.

Final responses should be evidence-based and concise. Name changed files, exact
verification commands, failed checks, skipped checks, and any uncertainty. If
verification was not run, say why. Do not include raw private logs, credentials,
session titles, prompt text, or reasoning traces.

Common commands:

- `python3 scripts/sync_agent_parity.py --check`
- `python3 scripts/audit_opencode_output_quality.py`
- `python3 scripts/audit_agent_tooling_parity.py`
- `python3 scripts/tests.py run --spec <name>.spec.ts`
- `python3 scripts/sessions.py deploy --session <id> --title "..." --message "..."`
