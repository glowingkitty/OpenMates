## Basic Design Principles


## Target Users & their needs

- Web app & docs:
	- wide general audience, with tech experience ranging from "never used AI tools before and don't use a laptop but only my phone" to "uses a few AI tools like ChatGPT and Sora on a regular base", "skeptical of AI tools but open to look into the topic" to "tech and AI enthusiasts who are deeply familiar with all the latest tools and models and use them multiple times a day."
	- consequences:
		- simple easy to understand UI
		- prevent usage of tech terms which many people are either unfamiliar with or have skepticism against (use "digital team mates" instead of "AI agents" for example, prevent the use of "LLMs" and other tech terms outside of developer facing communication - meaning, prefer alternative better to understand terms when reasonable)
- API / Developer docs
	- software developers with a wide range of experience, ranging from people who have only experience using AI tools to let AI write the full code - up to developers who are skeptical of AI but want to give it a chance, and experienced software developers who are experienced with AI tech / projects

- basic design principles
	- reuse of common design patterns from chat apps like telegram / signal / WhatsApp
	- focus on balancing simplicity with lots of great features, but without overcomplicating UI
