# Calendar Sync Integration

> **Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Overview
Enable calendar integration to connect OpenMates chats with calendar events, supporting both read-only reminder viewing and bi-directional event creation with Google Calendar.

## Features

### 1. ICS Calendar Support (Read-Only)
**Purpose**: Display chats with reminders in standard calendar format
- **Format**: Industry-standard ICS (iCalendar) format
- **Scope**: Read-only viewing of chat reminders
- **Use Case**: Users can subscribe to OpenMates chat reminders in any calendar app
- **Export**: Generate ICS feed of chats where user has set reminders

### 2. Google Calendar Integration (Bi-Directional)
**Purpose**: Two-way sync between OpenMates and Google Calendar

#### 2.1 Read Reminders
- Import existing calendar events as chat reminders
- Sync reminder times with calendar event times
- Update chat reminder status when calendar events change

#### 2.2 Create Chats from Calendar Events
- **Trigger**: Mention "@OpenMates" in Google Calendar event description
- **Action**: Automatically create new OpenMates chat for that calendar entry
- **Context**: Chat inherits event title, description, attendees, and timing
- **Sync**: Chat updates reflect back to calendar event (optional)

## Technical Implementation

### ICS Calendar Generation
```
GET /api/calendar/ics/{user_id}
- Authentication: User token or calendar-specific token
- Response: ICS format with chat reminders as events
- Caching: Update on reminder changes
```

### Google Calendar Integration
```
OAuth 2.0 Flow:
1. User authorizes Google Calendar access
2. Store refresh token securely
3. Periodic sync via background tasks

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/calendar/google/connect - OAuth flow
- GET /api/calendar/google/events - Fetch events
- POST /api/calendar/google/webhook - Event change notifications
```

### Data Model Extensions
```sql
-- New table for calendar integrations
calendar_integrations:
- user_id (FK)
- provider (enum: google, ics)
- access_token (encrypted)
- refresh_token (encrypted)
- webhook_id (for Google notifications)
- last_sync_at
- settings (JSON)

-- Link chats to calendar events
chat_calendar_events:
- chat_id (FK)
- calendar_event_id (external ID)
- provider
- sync_direction (enum: read_only, bi_directional)
```

## User Experience

### ICS Calendar Setup
1. User navigates to Settings â†’ Calendar
2. Toggle "Enable ICS Calendar"
3. Copy generated ICS URL
4. Subscribe in preferred calendar app
5. View chat reminders as calendar events

### Google Calendar Setup
1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Calendar â†’ Google Calendar
2. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
3. Complete OAuth authorization
4. Configure sync preferences:
   - Import existing events as reminders
   - Enable @OpenMates mention detection
   - Set sync frequency

### Creating Chats from Calendar
1. Create/edit Google Calendar event
2. Add "@OpenMates" anywhere in event description
3. OpenMates automatically creates chat with:
   - Title: Event title
   - Initial message: Event description (minus @OpenMates)
   - Participants: Event attendees (if they have OpenMates accounts)
   - Reminder: Set to event start time

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Calendar tokens stored encrypted in Vault
- ICS feeds require authentication
- Users control which chats are included in calendar sync

### Permission Model
- Granular calendar permissions (read vs. read/write)
- Users can revoke calendar access anytime
- Audit log for calendar-triggered actions

### Rate Limiting
- Google Calendar API rate limits respected
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Webhook-driven updates preferred over polling

## Integration Points

### Backend Apps
- **Core API**: Calendar endpoints and OAuth handling
- **AI App**: Process @OpenMates mentions in event descriptions
- **Sync Service**: Real-time updates between calendar and chats

### Frontend
- **Settings Panel**: Calendar integration management
- **Chat Interface**: Show calendar event context when chat was created from event
- **Reminder UI**: Enhanced with calendar event details

### External Services
- **Google Calendar API**: Primary integration
- **ICS Standard**: Broad calendar app compatibility
- **Webhook Services**: Real-time event change notifications

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **Multiple Calendar Support**: Outlook, Apple Calendar, CalDAV
- **Smart Scheduling**: AI suggests meeting times based on chat context
- **Calendar Templates**: Pre-configured event types that create specific chat types
- **Team Calendars**: Shared calendar integration for team workspaces

### Advanced Features
- **Meeting Summaries**: Auto-generate meeting notes in linked chats
- **Action Items**: Extract tasks from calendar events into chat todos
- **Availability Sharing**: Show calendar availability in chat contexts
- **Location Integration**: GPS-based chat reminders for location-based events
