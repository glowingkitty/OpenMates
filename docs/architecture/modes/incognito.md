# Incognito mode architecture 

> planned architecture 

- hides all existing chats temporarily (?)
- no app settings & memories, connected app accounts, or user interests or previous chats are submitted to chat processing (resulting in as anonymous processing as possible)
- chat isnâ€™t stored in indexeddb and also not on server in cache but only stored in memory on user device (automatically wiped on tab reload)
