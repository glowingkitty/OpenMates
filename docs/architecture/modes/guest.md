# Guest mode architecture 

> planned architecture 

- similar to incognito mode, but with additional passcode which needs to be defined to start guest mode and reentered to end guest mode
- mode limited to current device, not all connected devices
- passcode is also used to encrypt master encryption key, so guest also canâ€™t access encryption key via developer console to decrypt existing chats
