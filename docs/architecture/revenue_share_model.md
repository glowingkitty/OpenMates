# Revenue share model architecture

Question: how to ensure creators and news outlets and website owners can still make a living in a time where users will interact with their content more and more using AI agents who can scrape their websites and read their YouTube transcripts to answer questions?

## Revenue split model ideas

> Note: these are only some first ideas

Craators get the majority split for every skill call that directly uses loads their content.

Example: Videos | Get transcript
- 5 credits (around 0.005 EUR) cost per skill use
- 3 credits would go to YouTube creator, 1 credit would go to OpenMates
1 credit would go to YouTube
- YouTube creator could sign up to get their revenue split payed out as actual money

Example: Web | Search
- 10 credits (around 0.01 EUR) cost per skill use
- 6 credits would cover the cost of the API request
- 3 credits would be split up among all website providers listed in the search results (except if user marks website as hidden / not relevant, then provider gets no credits for that user)
- 1 credit would go to OpenMates

Same principle would apply to websites whos content is read by user request.
Example: Web | Read
- 5 credits cost per skill use to read a website content
- 4 credits would go to creator
- 1 credit would go to OpenMates

If creator isnt signed up yet:
- for every channel and every website revenue is reserved for creator and possible to pay out up to 6 months after skill use. in other words, creators can claim revenue of up to 6 months of user requests after they signed up. After that, revenue becomes used for educational programs for example?

### Prevent harmful, hateful and enraging content

If a video is clearly harmful, hateful, spreading false news or is designed to enrage users, then no credits will be payed out for that video and a strike will be added for that channel for the specific video url. Strikes based on 3 different video urls occurred, the channel will be auto romoved from the creator payput program. Maybe also add it then automatically to ignore list of channels which are not processed anympre, including the reason.
