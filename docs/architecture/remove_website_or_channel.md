# Remove website or channel architecture

> Not yet implemented

Together with skills that can search the web, read website content and get video transcrips we also need to implement an option for creators and publishers to remove their websites and YouTube channels from being visible and processable on OpenMates.

## "Remove websites & channels" settings menu

This menu is accessible without requiring being signed into an account. It allows users to add their website domains and youtube channels to an ignore list, so it neither shows up in search results and cant be processed either by app skills. It also informs the user that they could earn income if they choose instead to join the creator program. If they choose to continue with removing their website or channel:

### Websites

User needs to add OpenMatesBot to robots.txt for their website or add a txt domain entry.

### YouTube channels

User needs to confirm channel ownership via oAuth login.
