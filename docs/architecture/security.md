# Security architecture

> This is the planned architecture. Keep in mind there can still be differences to the current state of the code.

## Zero-Knowledge Authentication

Our system uses a zero-knowledge authentication model: the server never sees passwords, passkeys, backup codes, or encryption keys in plaintext. Authentication requires both server-side verification of cryptographic hashes and client-side ability to decrypt the master key.

### Key Principles

- **Server = encrypted storage only**: It stores blobs it cannot decrypt
- **Dual verification authentication**:
  1. Server-side: Verifies the provided lookup hash exists in the user's registered lookup hashes
  2. Client-side: Successful login requires successful decryption of the master key
- **No plaintext credential verification**: The server never receives or verifies plaintext credentials
- **Two-step user identification**: 
  1. First, the server locates the user record using the email hash
  2. Then, it verifies authentication by checking if the provided lookup hash exists in the user's registered lookup hashes
- **Privacy-preserving lookups**: Server uses cryptographic hashes, never plaintext identifiers
- **Multiple login methods per user**: Users are encouraged to register multiple secure login options

## User Signup

- The client:
  - Generates a unique **master encryption key**
  - Encrypts that key (wrapped key) using the selected login method (e.g., password)
  - Computes:
    - `email_hash = SHA256(email)`
    - `lookup_hash = SHA256(email + login_secret)`  
      `login_secret` = password, passkey PRF value, or backup code
  - Sends to server:
    - Plaintext `email` and `username` (so server can send verification/security emails)
    - `email_hash`
    - `lookup_hash`
    - Wrapped master encryption key
    - Login method type (`password`, `passkey`, or `backup_code`)
- The server:
  - Stores `email`, `username`, etc., encrypted via `encryption_key_user_server` (stored in HashiCorp Vault)
  - Stores `email_hash` as an indexed field for fast login lookup
  - Adds `lookup_hash` to the user’s `user_lookup_hashes` array
  - Associates the wrapped encryption key with that `lookup_hash` and method
  - (If method is password) Requires the user to:
    - Set up OTP-based 2FA (e.g., TOTP via Google Authenticator)
    - Confirm email

## Login Flow

Three supported login methods:
- **Password (+ 2FA)**
- **Passkey**
- **Backup Code**

Login always proceeds as follows:

### 1. Client sends:

- `email_hash = SHA256(email)`
- `lookup_hash = SHA256(email + login_secret)`
- (Optional) `otp_code` (required for password logins)

### 2. Server logic:

1. **User identification (first step)**: Lookup user by `email_hash`
2. **Authentication verification (second step)**: Within the identified user record, check if the provided `lookup_hash` exists in the user's `user_lookup_hashes` array
3. If the lookup hash is found:
   - If login method is password:
     - Verify the submitted `otp_code` against user's registered TOTP secret
     - If TOTP is missing or incorrect → reject
   - If everything matches:
     - Return the **corresponding encrypted wrapped master key** and **Argon2 salt**
4. If either step fails (user not found by email hash OR lookup hash not in user's array):
   - Return generic failure (does not disclose which specific step failed)

### 3. Client:

- Derives a key using `Argon2(login_secret, salt)`
- Attempts to decrypt the wrapped master key
- If decryption succeeds → login is successful
- The decrypted key is stored in localStorage or sessionStorage depending on “stay logged in”

### 🔁 Multiple login methods per user:

Each login method (password, passkey, backup code) has:
- Its own `lookup_hash`
- Its own wrapped master key
- Its own Argon2 salt

This allows users to recover access using alternate methods if one is lost.

---

## Backup Codes

- Backup codes are generated and shown to the user during signup or in settings
- Each backup code:
  - Has a unique `lookup_hash = SHA256(email + backup_code)`
  - Has its own wrapped master key and salt
- Backup codes are single-use unless explicitly regenerated

---

## Passkey (WebAuthn)

- We use the WebAuthn [PRF extension](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/#prf-extension) to derive a **passkey secret** client-side
- `lookup_hash = SHA256(email + passkey_prf_secret)`
- Like all methods, this generates a unique wrapped master key and salt

---

## Chats

- Each chat has its own symmetric `encryption_key_chat`
- Chat keys are encrypted with the user’s decrypted `encryption_key_user_local` and uploaded
- Messages are AES-encrypted/decrypted on the client

---

## API Keys

- API keys authenticate without requiring the user email on each request; the API key alone serves as credential  
- For each API key, the server stores:
  - `api_key_hash = SHA256(api_key)` for lookup  
  - wrapped master key encrypted with Argon2 derived from the API key  
  - Argon2 salt  
  - Status (active, revoked)  
  - Allowed IP addresses list  
  - Pending IP addresses list awaiting user confirmation  
  - Metadata (creation date, last used date, label, etc.)  
- On each API request, server looks up API key by hash  
- If request originates from an unknown IP, access is blocked and the IP is added to pending list  
- User receives notification in the web UI and must explicitly approve the new IP before requests from it are accepted  
- After IP approval, subsequent requests from the IP are accepted seamlessly  
- This approach provides strong protection against unauthorized API key usage, balancing usability and security  
- API keys allow loading the wrapped master key and encrypted user data; client-side SDK decrypts data using the API key

---

## App Skills

- If user hasn’t explicitly used an app skill via `@skill`, manual confirmation is required
- All input/output data is encrypted client-side and shown in the UI
- App skill output is filtered via a safety LLM to detect prompt injection and misuse

---

## App Settings & Memories

- Each app the user uses has its own `encryption_key_user_app`
- This key is generated on first use and encrypted with the user’s master encryption key
- App settings & memories are encrypted client-side before being uploaded

---

## Safety Layers

### Pre-processing

Each input request is passed through a lightweight LLM with output:

- `harmful_or_illegal_request_chance`
- `category`
- `selected_llm`

### Post-processing

The final LLM output is analyzed for:

- `follow_up_user_message_suggestions`
- `new_chat_user_message_suggestions`
- `harmful_or_illegal_response_chance` (0–10)
  - If >6: output is suppressed with:
    > “Sorry, I think my response was problematic. Could you rephrase and elaborate your request?”

### App Skill Output Security Scan

- `prompt_injection_attack_chance` evaluated per app skill output
- If >6:
  > “Content replaced with this security warning. Reason: Security scan revealed high chance of prompt injection attack.”

### Server Error Handling

If server fails:

> “Sorry, an error occurred while I was processing your request. Be assured: the OpenMates team will be informed. Please try again later.”
