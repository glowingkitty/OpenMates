# Slides App architecture

## Ideas

- use revealjs for creating, viewing, editing slides
- user alternative viewers to view PowerPoint files and Google sheets
- when being asked to edit PowerPoint files -> tell user file must be uploaded to Google slides if downloading and preventing formatting errors is essential? Or convert to revealjs? (But converting back to PowerPoint or google slides could be difficult)

## Focus modes
