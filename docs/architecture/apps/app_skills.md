# App skills architecture 

A skill outputs a json dict.


## Input fields

- needs to consider implementation of Rest api / docs generation (using Pydantic models)

## Output fields

### "previews"

List that contains all resulting outputs. For example: code files, websites, etc.

### "suggestions_follow_up_requests"

List of strings. Used to improve "suggestions_follow_up_requests" output from post-processing step, which happens once assistant response finished.

Example: Web | Search -> ["Search more in depth.", "Create a PDF report.", ...]

### "added_instructions"

Example: PDF | Read -> instruction on how to quote parts in document

### "previews[x].hash"

Each preview (example a code file, location, etc.) has a result_hash field - with a hash based on the content of all fields. Goal is to easily validate if a result was generated by the backend or made up by a user or modified by a user.
