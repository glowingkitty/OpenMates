# Events app architecture

> Not yet implemented. Idea stage.

## Feature Ideas

### Location-Based and Path-Based Event Search

**Idea:** Enable searching for events based on:
- **Near Location(s):** Find events near one or multiple specified locations
- **Along Travel Path:** Find events along a travel route/path the user is taking

**Considerations:**
- Integration with Maps functionality for route/path input
- Could leverage Travel app data for journey planning
- Spatial queries for event providers that support location data
- UI/UX for defining travel paths and search radius
- Cross-app integration: Events + Maps (+ Travel)
