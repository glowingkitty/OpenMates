## Skills

### Search classes

Search for classes on platforms like UrbanSports.
Idea: Searching for locations that support UrbanSports and similar subscriptions should be done via Maps app via optional parameter to filter for places that support those providers?

## Settings & Memories

### Trainer liked

Save trainers which you liked and what you remember to be great about their classes (example: great music, great instructions, etc.).

### Trainer ignore

Save trainers which you don't want to join again for a class and the reason (example: bad instructions, difficult to understand, bad music, etc.).
