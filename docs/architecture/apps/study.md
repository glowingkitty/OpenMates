# Study app architecture

## Focuses

### Learn topic

Helps the user to learn a new topic for school, university, exams. Including using the Reminder app to repeat a topic / learning about a topic, but with new questions every time for example. And a focus on showing learning progress.

### Testing

Your digital team mate will ask you multiple rounds of questions to a topic and difficulty level, which you then need to answer, before it checks your answers for correctness.

### Socratic questioning

Will ask you strategic questions to help you examine your beliefs, uncover assumptions and arrive at a deeper understanding through your own reasoning.
