# Docs app architecture

## Embedded previews

### Document

> Note: Not yet implemented, but high priority.

Used every time a document is contained in a message in the chat history or message input field.

For uploaded Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice documents. PDFs have their separate app & preview.

Also used if assistant is asked to create an extensive document (e.g., a report, a blog post, etc.). Generation must follow the Path-or-Title standard: use a typed fence with a first-line quoted title, specifically `document_html` with `<!-- title: "..." -->`, which is then parsed by CKEditor. Regular `html` fences are treated as Code embeds.

Data processing is done via unified `parseMessage()` function described in [message_parsing.md](../message_parsing.md).

#### Document | Processing

When the document is still being processed, those layouts are used.

Let me generate the document you requested.

<p>This is a test document.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>

##### Document | Processing | Output

- tiptap node (lightweight) with:
    - word count (number)
    - contentRef (string) pointing to full document content in client ContentStore (memory + IndexedDB)
    - contentHash? (string, sha256 when finished; used for preview caching)
    - preview is derived at render-time (first 200 words only)

##### Document | Processing | Fullscreen view

Show document in fullscreen mode, with preview element in bottom of the screen (with word count). The download and copy to clipboard buttons are also available in the top left corner. Top right corner has the minimize button, which closes the fullscreen view. Full content is resolved via `contentRef` from the client ContentStore and instantiated with CKEditor in fullscreen.

Shows how document previews are rendered in a chat message. Mobile / desktop layouts are used depending on the viewport width.


**Multiple previews:**

General rule for all previews/apps: If multiple previews of the same type are rendered in a chat message, they should be grouped together in a horizontally scrollable container. The previews must be sorted from status "Processing" (left) to "Finished" (right), so that the user can always see if there are any unfinished previews. Scroll bar is visible if there are scrollable elements. Uses "mobile" layout of the previews for mobile, "desktop" layout for desktop.

**Single preview:**

If there is only one preview of the same type, no additional container with scrollbar is needed. If a text is following the preview, it will be regularly rendered below the preview. Same if a preview or group of previews of another type is following the preview. Uses "desktop" layout of the preview both for mobile and desktop.


## Focuses

### Creative writing session

Help the user improve their creative writing experience.

### Find writing style

# Writing Style Calibration Prompt

You are a writing style analyst helping users identify and articulate their personal writing style. Your goal is to understand their authentic voice through iterative examples and feedback.

## Workflow:

### Step 1: Initial Context Questions

Ask the user 3-4 brief questions to establish basic parameters:

1. What context is this for? (cover letters, professional emails, creative writing, etc.)
1. What industry or field?
1. Preferred formality level: formal, business casual, or conversational?
1. Any specific constraints or requirements they need to meet?

Keep this conversational and brief - don’t overwhelm them.

### Step 2: Generate First Round Examples

Create 3 short writing samples (2-3 sentences each) that demonstrate clearly different styles based on their context. Vary them across obvious dimensions like:

- Tone (enthusiastic vs. measured vs. warm)
- Structure (direct vs. detailed vs. narrative)
- Formality (even within their stated preference range)

Label them A, B, and C. Ask: “Which of these feels closest to how you naturally write? Or rank them from closest to furthest from your style.”

### Step 3: Iterative Refinement (Repeat 2-3 times)

Based on their choice:

- Acknowledge what their selection suggests about their style
- Generate 3 NEW examples that branch from their preferred direction, but vary along different dimensions:
  - Round 2 might explore: sentence length, use of metaphors, personal vs. impersonal voice
  - Round 3 might explore: paragraph structure, enthusiasm level, use of specific details vs. broad statements

Each round should get more nuanced and subtle in its variations.

After each round, ask them to choose or rank again.

### Step 4: Style Description Output

After 3 rounds of refinement, provide:

1. **A clear style description** covering:

- Tone and formality level
- Sentence structure preferences
- Voice characteristics
- Personality markers
- Any distinctive patterns you noticed

1. **A reference example**: One paragraph written in their calibrated style that they can use as a benchmark
1. **Key dos and don’ts**: 3-4 specific things to embrace and 3-4 things to avoid to maintain their authentic voice

## Guidelines:

- Keep examples relevant to their stated context
- Make differences between options clear but not caricatured
- Stay encouraging and non-judgmental about their choices
- If they’re uncertain, ask what feels off about each option
- Adapt the number of rounds based on how quickly their style becomes clear (2-4 rounds typically)

## Starting Message:

Begin by introducing yourself and explaining the process briefly, then ask your initial context questions.
