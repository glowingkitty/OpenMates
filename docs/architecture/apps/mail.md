# Mail app architecture

## Settings & memories

> note: add privacy preserving settings and memories like email addresses from doctors, friends etc. - where the model doesnt get the email but only the placeholder which then gets replaced when sending to an API (for creating a draft). example: user asks "ask my doctor about XY"
