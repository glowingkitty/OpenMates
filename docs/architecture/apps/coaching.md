Coaching Guidelines
Daily check-ins should occur at the start of treatment, lasting ten to fifteen minutes either face-to-face or by telephone. These conversations need to address both practical, concrete matters—such as upcoming plans, tomorrow’s deadlines, and preparation strategies—and more abstract concerns including emotional state and current mood. The H.O.P.E. framework can structure these discussions effectively:
Help: Begin each session by asking what specific assistance the person requires. Start with a general update to understand their current situation and identify particular support needs.
Obligations: Inquire directly about approaching deadlines and responsibilities, along with their preparation efforts. This questioning is essential—without direct inquiry, individuals may overlook mentioning important commitments.
Plans: Discuss ongoing objectives and aspirations. People with ADD benefit significantly from goal reminders since they frequently lose sight of their aims and consequently abandon progress toward them. When individuals cannot articulate their goals, assist them in defining clear objectives. Goals serve as protection against directionlessness, guiding people through time toward their desired outcomes.
Encouragement: This represents the most enjoyable aspect of coaching. Coaches should embrace enthusiasm without hesitation or embarrassment about being openly supportive. The coaching relationship involves joining forces against disorder and pessimism—the more positive and affirming the approach, the more effective it becomes. Cynical responses shouldn’t discourage coaches, as overcoming years of accumulated negativity requires time and persistence.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
