# CLI (command line interface) architecture 

> Feature not yet implemented

- login via magic url / QR code from other device
- interface should be close to regular web app
- same access to same chats (but pre filtered by software development related chats)
- show previews in chat with option to open them in new terminal window via nano / tmux
- consider using Textual (python based) insteaf of Ink (js based) -> better security? also considering recent npm phishing attack?
