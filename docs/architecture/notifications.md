# Notifications architecture 

- implement together with PWA (progressive web app) & offline support, for support also on iOS devices
- use notifications both for responses to user messages, as well as optional social media posts & promotions (which allows user to directly ask questions or start a conversation)
- use as alternative to social media for those who donâ€™t want to use social media (or email)
