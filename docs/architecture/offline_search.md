# Offline Search Architecture

**Status**: ðŸš§ Not Implemented Yet

## Overview

This document describes the proposed architecture for implementing privacy-preserving, offline-capable search functionality for chats and messages in OpenMates. The design maintains the zero-knowledge encryption model while providing fast, responsive search across thousands of messages.

## Core Principle: Incremental Indexing + Encrypted Storage

**Don't rebuild on every message** - instead, maintain an incremental search index that updates only when new content arrives.

---

## Data Structure

### New IndexedDB Stores (2 additions):

#### 1. `search_index` store
```
- message_id (primary key)
- chat_id (indexed)
- encrypted_search_data (contains: tokens, preview snippet)
- created_at (indexed)
- metadata (role, has_attachments, word_count)
```

**Indexes**:
- `chat_id` - for filtering search by chat
- `created_at` - for date range queries
- `chat_id_created_at` - compound index for efficient chat + time queries

#### 2. `chat_search_metadata` store
```
- chat_id (primary key)
- encrypted_title_tokens
- message_count
- last_indexed_message_id
- indexed_at
```

---

## When Things Get Indexed

### Real-time (on message arrival):
1. New message saved to `messages` store
2. Immediately decrypt content with chat key
3. Generate search tokens (words, phrases)
4. Re-encrypt tokens with same chat key
5. Insert one record into `search_index`
6. Update `chat_search_metadata` counter

**Cost per message**: 1 decrypt + 1 encrypt + 2 IndexedDB writes (~5-10ms)

### Background (on app load or idle):
1. Check for unindexed messages (compare `messages` vs `search_index`)
2. Process in batches of 50 messages
3. Yield to UI thread between batches (requestIdleCallback)
4. Index only the 100 most recent chats
5. Mark completion in metadata store

**One-time cost**: Runs once per device, then maintains incrementally

---

## Search Flow

### User types query â†’ Results appear:

#### 1. Query preparation (instant)
- Tokenize search terms
- Apply filters (date range, chat_id, role)

#### 2. Index scan (5-20ms for 10k messages)
- Query `search_index` store using IndexedDB indexes
- Filter by metadata first (no decryption needed)
- Get candidate message_ids

#### 3. Token matching (20-100ms in Web Worker)
- Decrypt `encrypted_search_data` for candidates
- Match tokens against query
- Score and rank matches
- Return top 50 message_ids

#### 4. Result hydration (10-50ms)
- Fetch full Message objects from `messages` store
- Decrypt only the matched messages (not all messages!)
- Format for display with highlighted snippets

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Encryption Strategy
- **Search tokens encrypted with chat key** (not master key)
  - Maintains chat-level isolation
  - Server can never read search data
  - Survives page reload via IndexedDB

### Scope Limiting
- **Only index 100 most recent chats**
  - Covers 99% of user searches
  - Keeps index size manageable
  - Old chats fall back to slower on-demand search

### Performance Optimizations

#### Metadata-first filtering
- Check `has_content`, `role`, `created_at` before decryption
- Reduces decryption operations by 70-90%

#### Web Worker decryption
- Token matching happens off main thread
- UI stays responsive during search

#### Result pagination
- Decrypt top 20 matches first
- Load more on scroll (lazy decryption)

### Storage Efficiency
- **Token deduplication**
  - Store unique tokens per message, not full text
  - Average: 150 bytes per message vs 5KB full content
  - 10k messages = ~1.5MB search index

### Tokenization Strategy

#### Basic tokenization:
```
text.toLowerCase()
  .split(/\W+/)
  .filter(token => token.length > 2)
  .slice(0, 100) // Limit tokens per message
```

#### Considerations:
- Skip common stop words (the, a, an, is, etc.)
- Support multi-language tokenization
- Handle code snippets differently (preserve camelCase, snake_case)
- Extract hashtags and mentions as special tokens
- Consider n-gram indexing for partial word matching

---

## Maintenance Operations

### Index Pruning
- Delete search entries when message deleted
- Delete chat metadata when chat deleted
- Periodic cleanup of orphaned entries

### Re-indexing Triggers
- Chat key rotation (decrypt with old key, re-encrypt with new)
- Master key recovery (re-encrypt all chat keys, then search index)
- Schema version upgrade (rebuild index with new tokenization)

### Corruption Recovery
- If search fails, mark index as stale
- Background job rebuilds affected chat's index
- Graceful degradation: fall back to full-text scan

---

## Fallback Strategy

### For searches that miss the index:
1. User searches for term in old unindexed chat
2. System detects no results from index
3. Offer "Search older messages" button
4. On-demand: fetch chat messages, decrypt, scan
5. Optionally index that chat while searching

This keeps initial indexing fast while still supporting comprehensive search when needed.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Index update on new message**: < 10ms
- **Search 10k indexed messages**: < 100ms
- **Full result rendering**: < 200ms
- **Background indexing**: 50 messages/second (non-blocking)
- **Storage overhead**: ~150 bytes per indexed message

---

## Privacy Guarantees Maintained

âœ… All search data encrypted at rest (chat key)
âœ… No plaintext ever in IndexedDB
âœ… Server never sees search index
âœ… Chat isolation preserved (separate keys)
âœ… Master key compromise doesn't expose search history directly
âœ… Search queries never logged or sent to server

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure
- Add new IndexedDB stores (`search_index`, `chat_search_metadata`)
- Implement basic tokenization
- Add index entry on new message save
- Simple keyword search (no ranking)

### Phase 2: Background Indexing
- Implement background indexing service
- Add `requestIdleCallback` batching
- Index 100 most recent chats on app load
- Progress indicator for indexing

### Phase 3: Advanced Search
- Move token matching to Web Worker
- Implement relevance ranking algorithm
- Add search filters (date, chat, role)
- Result highlighting and snippets

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Implement metadata-first filtering
- Add result pagination
- Optimize tokenization for code/multi-language
- Performance monitoring and tuning

### Phase 5: Polish
- Fallback to on-demand search for old chats
- Index corruption recovery
- Search analytics (local only, privacy-preserving)
- User preferences (index scope, indexing schedule)

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
- **Attacker with IndexedDB access**: Cannot read search index (encrypted with chat keys)
- **Attacker with memory dump**: May see decrypted search results in memory (temporary)
- **Malicious browser extension**: Could intercept search queries (same risk as current message viewing)

### Mitigations
- Keep decrypted search results in memory for minimal time
- Clear search results when switching chats
- Consider memory encryption for high-security mode
- Regular security audits of search implementation

---

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
- Fuzzy matching (typo tolerance)
- Phrase search ("exact phrase")
- Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Regular expression search
- Search within code blocks specifically
- Search by file attachments
- Search by date ranges with natural language ("last week", "this month")

### AI-Powered Search
- Semantic search (meaning-based, not just keyword)
- Question answering over chat history
- Auto-suggest search queries
- Search result summarization

### Cross-Device Sync
- Sync search index across devices (encrypted)
- Differential sync to minimize bandwidth
- Conflict resolution for concurrent indexing

## Open Questions

1. **Should we index message edits/deletions?**
   - Track edit history in search?
   - Remove deleted messages from index immediately or with delay?

2. **How to handle very large messages?**
   - Truncate token extraction after N words?
   - Index only first paragraph?

3. **Should chat titles be indexed separately?**
   - Prioritize chat title matches vs message matches?
   - Separate search for "find chat by name"?

4. **Memory constraints on mobile?**
   - Smaller index scope (50 chats instead of 100)?
   - More aggressive cache eviction?
