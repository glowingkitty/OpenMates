# Share chat architecture

> not yet implemented. This is the planned architecture of a still to be implemented feature.

- options: “Share with user” and “Share with public”
- “Share with user” requires entering user email address
	- sends email with “chat was shared with you” and link /chat/{chatid}#key={encryption-key}
	- adds hash of email address to list of users who is allowed to view chat
	- once chat is opened in web app, server checks if email hash is on list of allowed users. If yes, hash of email is replaced with hash of email + hash of user id (so same user could access even after email change).
	- client receives the encrypted chat, uses the #{key} to decrypt the chat, then saves the key encrypted via client master encryption key under user settings “shared_chats_keys”
	- url is updated and key removed
	- on following reloads, the stored key is used for the chat and the #{key} url is no longer needed
- “Share with public”: similar principle and flow, just without the check if the user is allowed to access the chat and instead we only check for “shared_public” true or false
- should reliably prevent also indexing via search engines and also prevent the server from seeing the key in the url request
- user interface needs to show which messages are not yet synced with public version and allow to sync / update public chat
