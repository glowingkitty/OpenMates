# Voice calling architecture

> First ideas. Not implemented yet.

## Recommended Solutions

### LiveKit (Recommended)
- **URL**: https://livekit.io/
- **Description**: Open source framework and cloud platform for voice, video, and physical AI agents
- **Key Features**:
  - Ultra low-latency edge infrastructure
  - Enterprise grade infrastructure (GDPR, SOC 2 Type 2, HIPAA compliant)
  - Built for scale with global regions
  - Simple and powerful APIs for voice agents
  - Automatic turn detection and interruption handling
  - Self-host or deploy to LiveKit Cloud
  - Used by major companies like OpenAI, Character AI, and others
- **Benefits**: Production-ready, scalable, comprehensive voice AI tools

### Alternative: Pipecat
- **URL**: https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat
- **Description**: Open source framework for building voice AI applications
- **Benefits**: Open source, flexible, good for custom implementations

## Implementation Considerations

- **Real-time Communication**: Need ultra-low latency for natural conversations
- **Scalability**: Must handle multiple concurrent voice calls
- **Integration**: Should integrate seamlessly with existing chat infrastructure
- **Security**: Voice data must be encrypted and secure
- **Multi-platform**: Support for web, mobile, and desktop applications
- **AI Integration**: Easy integration with existing AI models and conversation flows

## Architecture Notes

- Voice calling should be an extension of the existing chat system
- Consider using WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections where possible
- Implement proper fallback mechanisms for network issues
- Ensure compatibility with existing authentication and user management systems
