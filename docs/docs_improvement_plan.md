# OpenMates Documentation Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to unify and improve the OpenMates documentation structure. The current documentation has valuable content but suffers from inconsistent organization, unclear navigation, and mixed purposes across different folders.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive technical content**: Detailed architecture documentation covering security, message processing, and app specifications
- **Rich visual assets**: Extensive image collection with Figma designs and screenshots
- **Multiple perspectives**: Documentation covers user stories, design guidelines, and technical implementation
- **Community-focused**: Clear contributing guidelines and community links

### Issues Identified

#### 1. **Inconsistent Folder Structure**
- Mixed purposes in folders (e.g., `architecture/` contains both high-level and implementation details)
- Unclear hierarchy between different documentation types
- Scattered related content across multiple locations

#### 2. **Navigation Challenges**
- No clear entry point for different user types (developers, users, contributors)
- Missing table of contents and cross-references
- Deep nesting makes content hard to discover

#### 3. **Content Organization Issues**
- Technical implementation details mixed with user-facing documentation
- Incomplete documentation (many "TODO" and "Note: Not yet implemented" markers)
- Inconsistent formatting and structure across files

#### 4. **Missing Documentation Types**
- No getting started guide
- Missing API documentation structure
- No troubleshooting or FAQ sections
- Limited user guides for specific features

## Proposed Unified Structure

### 1. **Root Level Organization**

- Review `backend/core/api/app/services/directus/user/` for user management
- Check for TODO/FIXME comments in authentication files
- Analyze test files to understand expected behavior

**Example 2: App Framework Analysis**
- Read `backend/apps/base_app.py` to understand app framework
- Examine `backend/apps/base_skill.py` for skill development patterns
- Review all `backend/apps/*/app.yml` files to understand app configurations
- Check which apps have complete skill implementations
- Analyze Docker setup in `backend/apps/Dockerfile.base`

**Example 3: Frontend Component Analysis**
- Read component files in `frontend/packages/ui/src/components/`
- Examine routing in `frontend/apps/web_app/src/routes/`
- Review state management and data flow
- Check for TODO/FIXME comments in frontend code
- Analyze responsive design implementations

#### **Status Determination Criteria**

**✅ Implemented Criteria:**
- Feature works and is available to users
- Code is complete and functional
- Users can actually use the feature
- No major bugs or limitations

**📋 Planned Criteria:**
- Feature is designed but not yet working
- May have architecture documentation but no working code
- Users cannot use the feature yet
- Implementation timeline may be specified

### **Research Validation Tasks**
