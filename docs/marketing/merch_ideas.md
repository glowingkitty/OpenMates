# Merch ideas

Instead of creating boring stickers with just the project logo on it, lets create something more fun that looks great and / or has great catchphrases.

## Stickers

- change profile pictures of mates to vector based drawings with individual characteristics and optimized to look fun and cool even for areas that are intuitively connected with being more boring (like finance or business development)
- profile pictures are used for stickers, can be used to express interest areas of person
- also integrate in same stickers or separate stickers slogans / fun sentences / inside jokes
- add "furry mode" in mates settings of web app that switches profile pictures to furrsonas of characters
- extra furry versions of stickers
