security_measures:
  device_fingerprinting:
    purpose: >
      To enhance account security, prevent fraudulent access, and distinguish between new and recognized devices during login and session validation.
    data_collected:
      - User-Agent string (browser, OS, device type information)
      - IP address (used temporarily to derive approximate geo-location like country/city, then discarded from the device record)
    storage: >
      A unique, stable hash is generated based on a combination of the collected signals. This hash acts as an identifier for a recognized device/browser environment and is the only value stored in the device record. Browser/OS type and derived country code may be used transiently for risk assessment and notifications but are not stored with the device record. Raw IP addresses are NOT stored as part of the device record itself.
    ip_logging: >
      For security monitoring and abuse prevention, IP addresses associated with *failed* login attempts (invalid password or 2FA code) may be logged separately with limited retention periods. In addition, certain security/compliance events (for example: successful backup-code logins or successful device verifications) may be logged with IP for audit purposes with limited retention. IP addresses are also used for rate limiting login attempts.
