> _The following documentation (as well as the code) are still in an early alpha stage. Keep in mind the current release of OpenMates is for developers and early testers only and some features are still missing._

### Goal

![Goal header image](./docs/internal/slides/openmates_pitch_slides/goal.jpg)

OpenMates aims to be the most user-friendly, privacy-focused and provider-independent AI agent software. Beyond being a powerful tool for daily tasks, it is designed with a strong focus on **education and inspiration** — empowering users to learn and discover new ideas through interactive AI assistance.

#### Apps

![Apps header image](./docs/internal/slides/openmates_pitch_slides/apps.jpg)

Apps are one of the core components of OpenMates. They allow your digital team mates to use various external providers to fullfill your requests - from searching the web, finding meetups, finding restaurants, generating images, transcribing videos, and much more.
